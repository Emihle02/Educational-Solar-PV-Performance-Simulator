Solar panel web application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript in VSCode. All of the code is in one folder.
It consits of 5 cards, the first being the location settings, in the location settings the user pick a location which the coordinates are generated. After that the optimum tilt angle
is calcualated. Currently it follows the rule of thumb of a solar panel should be set to the latitude of the location. 

In the controls card, the user gets to control the different types of angles and see the affect of the change in the output power graph which is the power per hour and the PV diagram
should also be affected by the change in angles.

As of the 9th of August: 
solar panel diagram in PV module is not there yet needs more detail. I want it to look like this diagram found on this page.

The output power graph is not functioning yet 
The map works perfectly
Controls are okay, need more work in terms of when you change the controls it should show the affects on the graph and PV module. 

The focus for now is getting the peak generated power, controls to influence the output power graph.
